# InstaNews

A one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.


## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS/SASS, and Javascript/jQuery. 

 
## Personal Learnings
During this project I learned how to pull an API using JSON and have it dynamically change depending on the search result. I also learned about grid and how to implement it in place of flex. My jQuery skills have improved as well and I learned how to inject css and html using it. Overall, this project made me a much better web developer.
