A one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.


## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
 
## Personal Learnings
This project proved more difficult than I thought it would be. I learned how to pull an API using JSON and have it dynamically change depending on the search result. I also learned about grid which was pretty cool.
